Certainly, lets break down the various concepts and features you mentioned in the context of the ApplicationContext in Spring using Java-based configuration.

**ApplicationContext:**
The ApplicationContext is an advanced container in Spring that provides a wealth of features beyond basic bean management. It extends the capabilities of the BeanFactory and serves as a central hub for managing beans, handling dependencies, and providing additional services to Spring applications.

**Bean Management:**
The ApplicationContext manages the lifecycle of beans, from creation to destruction. It ensures that beans are created and initialized correctly based on their configuration.

**Dependency Injection:**
The ApplicationContext supports dependency injection, where dependencies are automatically injected into beans. This reduces the need for manual object creation and wiring.

**Inversion of Control (IoC):**
The ApplicationContext embodies the IoC principle by taking control of creating and managing objects. Instead of you manually instantiating objects, the ApplicationContext injects them into your application.

**Bean Scopes:**
The ApplicationContext supports various bean scopes such as singleton (default), prototype, request, session, and more. These scopes define how many instances of a bean are created and how they are managed.

**Configuration Management:**
In Java-based configuration, you use annotations like `@Configuration` and `@Bean` to define bean configurations. The ApplicationContext uses these configurations to create and manage beans.

**Lazy Initialization:**
Beans can be lazily initialized in the ApplicationContext, meaning they are created only when they are first requested. This improves application startup time and memory usage.

**AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming):**
The ApplicationContext supports the integration of AOP, allowing you to add cross-cutting concerns to your beans. This enables features like logging, security, and transaction management.

**Internationalization:**
The ApplicationContext offers internationalization and localization support. You can define message sources and retrieve messages in different languages based on the user's locale.

**Event Handling:**
The ApplicationContext supports event propagation and handling. Beans can publish events, and other beans can listen and respond to these events.

**Integration with Other Technologies:**
The ApplicationContext seamlessly integrates with various Spring technologies like Spring MVC for web applications and Spring Data for database access.

**Code Sample - Using ApplicationContext with Java Configuration:**

Let's create a simple example to illustrate how ApplicationContext works with Java-based configuration:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public UserService userService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        return new UserService(userRepository);
    }

    @Bean
    public UserRepository userRepository() {
        return new UserRepository();
    }
}

public class UserService {

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    // Business logic here
}

public class UserRepository {
    // Data access methods here
}

public class MainApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        
        UserService userService = context.getBean(UserService.class);
        // Use userService to perform business logic
    }
}
```

In this example, we've used the ApplicationContext to create and manage beans defined in the `AppConfig` class. The UserService bean has its dependency, UserRepository, automatically injected by the ApplicationContext.

The ApplicationContext simplifies bean management, encourages good design practices, and makes it easier to build maintainable and flexible Spring applications.
