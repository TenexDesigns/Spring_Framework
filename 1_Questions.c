# Spring Container vs Spring Context vs IOC container vs Application Context

The Spring Framework is built around the concept of a container, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of objects (beans) and their dependencies. There are two primary types of containers in Spring: the `BeanFactory` and the `ApplicationContext` [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10303413/what-is-the-difference-between-a-spring-application-context-and-a-spring-contain), [Source 2](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-application-context), [Source 4](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/basics.html), [Source 5](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/introduction.html), [Source 6](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-beanfactory-vs-applicationcontext), [Source 8](https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-core/different-spring-ioc-containers/), [Source 9](https://www.baeldung.com/inversion-control-and-dependency-injection-in-spring), [Source 10](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-applicationcontext-vs-spring-servlet-xml), [Source 11](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/2.5.6/reference/beans.html), [Source 13](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21866571/difference-between-javabean-and-spring-bean), [Source 16](https://www.javasavvy.com/java-beans-vs-spring-beans/), [Source 17](https://mossgreen.github.io/Java-Bean-VS-Spring-Bean/), [Source 24](https://medium.com/@mannverma/how-to-learn-javabeans-vs-spring-beans-vs-pojos-8bd9f31ca2fc).

- **Spring Container**: The Spring Container, also known as the Inversion of Control (IoC) container, is the core of the Spring Framework. It creates objects, wires them together, configures them, and manages their complete lifecycle. The Spring container uses the Dependency Injection (DI) principle to manage the components that make up an application.

- **BeanFactory**: `BeanFactory` is the simplest of containers, providing basic support for Dependency Injection (DI). It lazily loads all beans, deferring bean creation until the `getBean()` method is called. 

- **ApplicationContext**: `ApplicationContext` is a sub-interface of `BeanFactory` and provides additional functionality, such as the ability to resolve textual messages from a properties file, the ability to publish application events to interested event listeners, and integration with Spring's AOP features. It also preloads all singleton beans upon context startup to ensure they are ready to use when needed. Because of the additional functionality it provides, an `ApplicationContext` is generally preferred over a `BeanFactory`.

- **IOC container**: The term "IoC container" is generally used to refer to any type of container in the Spring Framework, whether it is a `BeanFactory` or an `ApplicationContext`. The IoC container is responsible for managing the objects of an application by using dependency injection to achieve inversion of control.

# Java Bean vs Spring Bean

Java Beans and Spring Beans have different meanings and are used in different contexts in Java development [Source 13](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21866571/difference-between-javabean-and-spring-bean), [Source 14](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-bean), [Source 16](https://www.javasavvy.com/java-beans-vs-spring-beans/), [Source 17](https://mossgreen.github.io/Java-Bean-VS-Spring-Bean/), [Source 24](https://medium.com/@mannverma/how-to-learn-javabeans-vs-spring-beans-vs-pojos-8bd9f31ca2fc).

- **Java Bean**: A Java Bean is a simple Java class that adheres to certain coding conventions. Specifically, it must have a public default (no argument) constructor, allow access to its properties using accessor (getter and setter) methods, and implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface. The idea behind JavaBeans is to create reusable software components that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool.

- **Spring Bean**: A Spring Bean, on the other hand, is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container. These beans are created based on bean definitions in the Spring configuration files or through annotations. The Spring container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of Spring Beans, which includes creating and configuring the beans, and managing their lifecycle. Spring Beans don't necessarily need to be JavaBeans, and they can have arguments in their constructors, and may not implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface.

# How do I list all the beans managed by the Spring framework?

You can list all the beans managed by


# How do I list all the beans managed by the Spring framework?

There are several ways to list all beans managed by the Spring framework, but here are two common methods:

1. Use the `ListableBeanFactory` interface. The `getBeanDefinitionNames()` method of this interface returns the names of all beans defined in the factory. Here is a simple example:

```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    private static ApplicationContext applicationContext;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        applicationContext = SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
        displayAllBeans();
    }

    public static void displayAllBeans() {
        String[] allBeanNames = applicationContext.getBeanDefinitionNames();
        for(String beanName : allBeanNames) {
            System.out.println(beanName);
        }
    }
}
```
This code will print all the beans from the application context container [Source 0](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-show-all-beans).

2. Use Spring Boot Actuator. Spring Boot Actuator provides a `/beans` endpoint which displays a complete list of all the Spring managed beans in your application. You can access this endpoint by navigating to `http://<address>:<management-port>/beans` in your web browser [Source 0](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-show-all-beans).

# What happens if multiple matching beans are available?

When multiple beans of the same type are available in the Spring container, Spring needs a way to determine which bean to inject. Here are a few strategies for handling this situation:

1. Use `@Primary`: If you annotate one of the beans with `@Primary`, Spring will give it precedence when performing autowiring.

```java
@Configuration
public class PersonConfig {
    @Bean
    @Primary
    public Person personOne() {
        return new Person("Harold", "Finch");
    }

    @Bean
    public Person personTwo() {
        return new Person("John", "Reese");
    }
}
```
In this example, `personOne` will be selected for injection when a `Person` bean is required [Source 13](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-same-class-multiple-beans).

2. Use `@Qualifier`: You can use the `@Qualifier` annotation to specify the name of the bean that should be wired.

```java
@Autowired
@Qualifier("personTwo")
private Person person;
```
In this example, `personTwo` will be injected into the `person` field [Source 19](https://freecontent.manning.com/choosing-from-multiple-beans-in-the-context/).

3. Use `@Conditional`: The `@Conditional` annotation can be used to conditionally create beans. For example, you can create a bean only if a certain other bean exists in the application context.

```java
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnBean(OtherModule.class)
class DependantModule {
  ...
}
```
In this example, the `DependantModule` is only loaded if there is a bean of class `OtherModule` in the application context [Source 23](https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-conditionals/).

If none of the above strategies are applied, and there are multiple matching beans, Spring will throw a `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException` [Source 22](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M4/reference/html/ch03s04.html).






# How does Spring manage and create objects?

Spring manages objects through its Inversion of Control (IoC) container, which is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of beans. Beans are objects that are managed by the Spring IoC container. When you define a bean, either in XML or using annotations, you are instructing Spring on how to create an instance of a class. The Spring container does this automatically for you when it starts up [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28882757/how-is-spring-container-created), [Source 1](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-application-context), [Source 8](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52126562/where-exactly-is-a-model-object-created-in-spring-mvc), [Source 10](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3615168/does-spring-dependency-injection-create-singleton-objects), [Source 11](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s02.html).

# How to use Spring to create objects?

In Spring, you can use the `@Bean` annotation in a configuration class to define how to create an instance of a class. Here is an example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        // create and return an instance of MyBean
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
```

In this example, the method `myBean()` is annotated with `@Bean`, which tells Spring that it should manage the object returned by this method as a bean. When the application context is created, Spring will call this method and register the returned object as a bean. The method name `myBean()` is by default used as the bean's ID, and you can retrieve the bean from the application context using this ID [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28882757/how-is-spring-container-created).

# What is the `record` keyword in Java?

The `record` keyword was introduced in Java 14 as a new kind of type declaration. A `record` is a special kind of class that is intended to be a transparent holder for immutable data. When you declare a `record`, the Java compiler automatically generates a final class that extends `java.lang.Record`, along with a number of methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. The `record` keyword helps to reduce boilerplate code when creating classes that are primarily used to hold immutable data [Source 15](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/11/05/java-records), [Source 16](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-jpa-java-records), [Source 26](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/record-keyword-in-java/).

Here is an example of a record:

```java
record Person(String name, int age) { }
```

This `record` declaration is equivalent to the following class declaration:

```java
public final class Person extends Record {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String name() { return name; }

    public int age() { return age; }

    // equals, hashCode, toString methods are also generated
}
```

# Explanation of other keywords in Spring

- `@Configuration`: This annotation is used on classes which define beans. The `@Configuration` annotation acts as a marker for any class declaring one or more `@Bean` methods. These classes are processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28882757/how-is-spring-container-created).

- `@Bean`: This annotation is used at the method level and tells Spring that the method will return an object that should be registered as a bean in the Spring application context. The lifecycle of the bean is managed by Spring, and the bean can be injected into other beans or layers in the application [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28882757/how-is-spring-container-created).

- `@Autowired`: This annotation is used to autowire bean on the setter method, constructor, a property, or methods with arbitrary names and/or multiple arguments. The `@Autowired` annotation injects object dependency implicitly [Source 1](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-application-context).






MORE EXPLAANANTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Certainly, I'll address the various areas, topics, and terminologies used in the provided code, as well as answer your questions:

1. **Spring Container vs Spring Context vs IOC Container vs Application Context:**
   - **Spring Container/IoC Container:** This is the overarching concept that manages the creation, configuration, and lifecycle of objects (beans). It manages the dependencies between these objects. It's also known as the IoC (Inversion of Control) container, meaning it controls the instantiation and management of objects.
   - **Spring Context/Application Context:** A Spring context is an instance of the IoC container. It's responsible for managing the beans and their configurations. It provides a runtime environment for beans to interact. The ApplicationContext is a specific type of IoC container in Spring that loads beans and provides additional functionalities like internationalization, event propagation, etc.

2. **Java Bean vs Spring Bean:**
   - **Java Bean:** In Java, a JavaBean is a reusable software component that follows specific conventions (like having a no-argument constructor, getter/setter methods). It's a plain Java class.
   - **Spring Bean:** A Spring bean is a Java object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container. It can be a JavaBean, but Spring beans can also be configured in various ways, including XML or annotations, to define their behaviors and dependencies.

3. **Listing Managed Beans in Spring:**
   In Spring, you can list all the managed beans using the following code:
   ```java
   String[] beanNames = context.getBeanDefinitionNames();
   for (String beanName : beanNames) {
       System.out.println(beanName);
   }
   ```

4. **Multiple Matching Beans:**
   If multiple beans of the same type are available in the context and Spring needs to inject one, it might lead to an ambiguity. Spring offers solutions like using `@Qualifier` annotation to specify which bean to inject or using the bean name as a qualifier.

5. **Creating Objects with Spring:**
   While it might seem like you're creating objects in your code, the Spring IoC container is actually creating these objects based on the configuration provided. The `@Bean` annotations in your configuration class instruct Spring on how to create and manage these objects. This way, you delegate the instantiation and configuration to Spring.

6. **Record Keyword and Other Keywords:**
   - **`record`:** Introduced in Java 16, the `record` keyword defines a compact and concise way to create classes that are primarily used to hold immutable data. They automatically generate `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods.
   - **`@Configuration`:** This annotation indicates that the class is a configuration class that provides bean definitions. Beans defined in such classes are registered with the Spring IoC container.
   - **`@Bean`:** This annotation is used to declare a method as a provider of a bean instance. The return value of the method is registered as a bean in the Spring context.
   
These concepts and annotations help Spring manage objects and control the flow of the application, making development more modular and easier to maintain.






---


  Absolutely, let's use code samples to further clarify the explanations:

1. **Listing Managed Beans in Spring:**
   
   To list all the managed beans in a Spring context, you can use the following code:

   ```java
   String[] beanNames = context.getBeanDefinitionNames();
   for (String beanName : beanNames) {
       System.out.println(beanName);
   }
   ```

2. **Multiple Matching Beans:**

   When multiple beans of the same type are available and you want to inject a specific one, you can use the `@Qualifier` annotation:

   ```java
   @Autowired
   @Qualifier("specificBean")
   private MyBean myBean;
   ```

3. **Creating Objects with Spring:**

   In the provided configuration class, the `@Bean` annotation indicates how Spring should create and manage beans:

   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class Hello {
       
       @Bean
       public String name(){
           return "Ranga";
       }

       // Other @Bean methods...

       @Bean
       public Person2 james(){
           return new Person2("James", 345, new Address(677, "King"));
       }

       // Other @Bean methods...
   }
   ```

   When you retrieve these beans using the Spring context, youre accessing instances that Spring has created and configured for you.

4. **Record Keyword and Other Keywords:**

   The `record` keyword, introduced in Java 16, simplifies the creation of classes for immutable data:

   ```java
   record Person(String name, int age) {}
   record Address(int lane, String city) {}
   ```

   The `@Configuration` annotation marks a class as a source of bean definitions:

   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class Hello {
       // ...
   }
   ```

   The `@Bean` annotation is used to declare a method as a bean provider:

   ```java
   @Bean
   public Person person() {
       var person = new Person("George", 45);
       return person;
   }
   ```

By utilizing these annotations and keywords, you let Spring manage the objects' lifecycle, configurations, and dependencies, reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability.
