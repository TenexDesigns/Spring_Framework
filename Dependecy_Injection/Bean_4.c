To answer your questions:

**1. Using beans in Spring ApplicationContext:**

To use beans in Spring ApplicationContext, you can follow these steps:

1. Configure the ApplicationContext with the necessary bean definitions. This can be done using XML configuration or Java-based configuration, as shown in your provided code.

2. Retrieve the ApplicationContext in your code. There are several ways to do this:

   a. Autowire the ApplicationContext:
   ```java
   @Autowired
   private ApplicationContext context;
   ```

   b. Implement the ApplicationContextAware interface:
   ```java
   public class ApplicationContextProvider implements ApplicationContextAware {
       private ApplicationContext applicationContext;
   
       @Override
       public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {
           this.applicationContext = applicationContext;
       }
   
       public ApplicationContext getContext() {
           return applicationContext;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Once you have the ApplicationContext, you can use the `getBean()` method to retrieve the beans by their name or type. For example:
   ```java
   // By name
   SomeClass bean = context.getBean("beanName", SomeClass.class);
   
   // By type
   SomeClass bean = context.getBean(SomeClass.class);
   ```

**2. Dependency Injection in Spring ApplicationContext:**

Dependency Injection (DI) is the process of providing the necessary dependencies to a class instead of the class creating them itself. In Spring ApplicationContext, DI is performed automatically based on the bean configurations. Here's how it works:

1. Define the dependencies in your bean configurations. This can be done using constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.

   a. Constructor Injection:
   ```java
   @Bean
   public Person2 person2(Address address) {
       return new Person2(address);
   }
   ```

   b. Setter Injection:
   ```java
   @Bean
   public Person2 person2(Address address) {
       Person2 person2 = new Person2();
       person2.setAddress(address);
       return person2;
   }
   ```

   c. Field Injection:
   ```java
   @Bean
   public Person2 person2(Address address) {
       Person2 person2 = new Person2();
       person2.setAddress(address);
       return person2;
   }
   ```

2. When the ApplicationContext initializes the beans, it automatically resolves the dependencies and injects them into the beans.

   For example, when creating a `Person2` bean, the ApplicationContext will check its dependencies and inject the `Address` bean by calling the appropriate constructor, setter, or field.

   ```java
   // Constructor Injection
   Person2 person2 = context.getBean(Person2.class);
   
   // Setter Injection
   Person2 person2 = context.getBean(Person2.class);
   
   // Field Injection
   Person2 person2 = context.getBean(Person2.class);
   ```

3. The ApplicationContext uses the bean configurations and dependency metadata to perform DI. It resolves the dependencies by looking up the beans in the container and injecting them into the dependent beans.

   This allows for loose coupling, easier testing, and modular code.

**3. Scopes of beans:**

In Spring, beans can have different scopes that define their lifecycle and number of instances. The supported scopes are:

1. Singleton (default): Only one instance of the bean is created and shared across the application.

2. Prototype: A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested.

3. Request: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request.

4. Session: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP session.

Each scope has its uses and advantages:

- Singleton: Suitable for stateless beans or beans that can be shared across the application. It reduces memory usage and improves performance by reusing instances.

- Prototype: Suitable for stateful beans or beans that require a new instance every time. It allows for better control over the lifecycle of the bean and avoids potential thread-safety issues.

- Request and Session: Suitable for web applications where beans need to be scoped to individual requests or sessions. It ensures that each user gets their own instance of the bean and avoids conflicts between users.

To define the scope of a bean in the ApplicationContext, you can use the `@Scope` annotation:

```java
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public Person2 person2(Address address) {
    return new Person2(address);
}
```

In this example, the `Person2` bean is defined with the prototype scope.

**4. Beans are typically instances of classes:**

In Spring, beans are typically instances of classes. This means that the beans are created based on the class definitions and configurations provided in the ApplicationContext.

The classes used as beans can be regular POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) or they can be annotated with Spring-specific annotations, such as `@Component`, `@Service`, or `@Repository`.

By creating beans as instances of classes, Spring can manage their lifecycle, perform dependency injection, and provide various features and functionalities.
