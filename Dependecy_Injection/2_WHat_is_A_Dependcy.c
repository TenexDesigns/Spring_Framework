In the context of Spring and dependency injection, a dependency is an object that another object (typically a bean) relies on to perform its functionality. Dependencies are typically objects that are required to fulfill a specific purpose within a class. The types of objects that can be dependencies are not limited to specific data types; they can be any object that a class depends on to operate correctly.

In Java, objects are instances of classes. Java provides a rich set of data types, including primitive types (e.g., `int`, `boolean`) and reference types (e.g., custom classes, strings, etc.).

**Types of Dependencies:**
1. **Primitive Types:** These are basic data types like `int`, `float`, `boolean`, etc. While they can be used as parameters, they are less common as dependencies in Spring, as they are usually used for method arguments or return values rather than injected dependencies.

2. **Reference Types (Objects):** These are instances of classes that you create. These are the types of objects that are typically used as dependencies in Spring.

**Where Dependencies Are Used:**
Dependencies can be passed to a class in various ways:

1. **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies can be injected via a class's constructor. This is a common approach in Spring and ensures that a class is in a valid state upon creation.

2. **Setter Injection:** Dependencies can be injected using setter methods of the class. This approach is more flexible and allows for optional dependencies.

3. **Method Injection:** Dependencies can be injected via regular methods, not just setters. This approach is less common and usually used in specific cases.

**In the Context of Spring:**
In the Spring framework, dependencies are typically managed by the Spring container (ApplicationContext). Dependencies can be any object (bean or non-bean) that a class requires. While not all dependencies need to be beans, Spring promotes the use of beans for easier management, configuration, and reusability.

In the `@Configuration` class, dependencies can be obtained through method parameters. These dependencies can be beans defined within the same `@Configuration` class or even beans from other configuration classes.

**Example:**
```java
@Configuration
public class Hello {

    @Bean
    public Person2 kelvin(String name, int age, Address address) {
        return new Person2(name, age, address);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `kelvin` bean method takes three parameters (`name`, `age`, and `address`), which are considered dependencies. These dependencies can be obtained from other beans (e.g., `name()` and `age()`) or from objects defined within the application context.

In summary, dependencies in Spring can be various types of objects (reference types) that a class requires to perform its functionality. They can be beans or non-beans and can be injected into a class through constructors, setters, or methods. The flexibility of dependency injection allows you to build more modular and maintainable applications.
