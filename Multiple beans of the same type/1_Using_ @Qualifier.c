In Spring, the `@Qualifier` annotation is used to resolve ambiguity when there are multiple beans of the same type and you want to inject one of them. You can use `@Qualifier` to specify the name of the bean that should be wired.

Given your code snippet:
```java
@Bean
@Qualifier
public Gamingconsole games(){
    var game =  new SnakeGame();
    return  game;
}
```
Here, `@Qualifier` is used without a value which is not the correct usage. The `@Qualifier` annotation should be used with a value, which is the name of the bean. This name is then used when you want to inject this specific bean. For example:

```java
@Bean
@Qualifier("snakeGame")
public Gamingconsole games(){
    var game =  new SnakeGame();
    return  game;
}
```
In this code, a bean of type `Gamingconsole` is created with the name "snakeGame". Now, if there are multiple beans of type `Gamingconsole`, you can use the `@Qualifier` annotation to specify which one you want to inject. 

For example:
```java
@Autowired
@Qualifier("snakeGame")
private Gamingconsole game;
```
In this code, the `game` field will be wired with the bean named "snakeGame" [Source 0](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-qualifier-annotation), [Source 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64429022/how-to-add-qualifier), [Source 4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring-qualifier-annotation-with-example/).

To fetch the bean from the application context, you can use the `getBean` method with the name and class of the bean:

```java
Gamingconsole game1 = context.getBean("snakeGame", Gamingconsole.class);
```
In this code, the `getBean` method will return the bean named "snakeGame" of type `Gamingconsole` [Source 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3512546/is-it-possible-to-use-multiple-qualifier-annotation-in-spring), [Source 11](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-bean-names).

Please note that if there are multiple beans of the same type and you didnt specify a `@Qualifier`, Spring will throw a `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException` because it wouldn't know which bean to inject.
