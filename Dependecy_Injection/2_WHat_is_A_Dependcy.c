In the context of Spring and dependency injection, a dependency is an object that another object (typically a bean) relies on to perform its functionality. Dependencies are typically objects that are required to fulfill a specific purpose within a class. The types of objects that can be dependencies are not limited to specific data types; they can be any object that a class depends on to operate correctly.

In Java, objects are instances of classes. Java provides a rich set of data types, including primitive types (e.g., `int`, `boolean`) and reference types (e.g., custom classes, strings, etc.).

**Types of Dependencies:**
1. **Primitive Types:** These are basic data types like `int`, `float`, `boolean`, etc. While they can be used as parameters, they are less common as dependencies in Spring, as they are usually used for method arguments or return values rather than injected dependencies.

2. **Reference Types (Objects):** These are instances of classes that you create. These are the types of objects that are typically used as dependencies in Spring.

**Where Dependencies Are Used:**
Dependencies can be passed to a class in various ways:

1. **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies can be injected via a class's constructor. This is a common approach in Spring and ensures that a class is in a valid state upon creation.

2. **Setter Injection:** Dependencies can be injected using setter methods of the class. This approach is more flexible and allows for optional dependencies.

3. **Method Injection:** Dependencies can be injected via regular methods, not just setters. This approach is less common and usually used in specific cases.

**In the Context of Spring:**
In the Spring framework, dependencies are typically managed by the Spring container (ApplicationContext). Dependencies can be any object (bean or non-bean) that a class requires. While not all dependencies need to be beans, Spring promotes the use of beans for easier management, configuration, and reusability.

In the `@Configuration` class, dependencies can be obtained through method parameters. These dependencies can be beans defined within the same `@Configuration` class or even beans from other configuration classes.

**Example:**
```java
@Configuration
public class Hello {

    @Bean
    public Person2 kelvin(String name, int age, Address address) {
        return new Person2(name, age, address);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `kelvin` bean method takes three parameters (`name`, `age`, and `address`), which are considered dependencies. These dependencies can be obtained from other beans (e.g., `name()` and `age()`) or from objects defined within the application context.

In summary, dependencies in Spring can be various types of objects (reference types) that a class requires to perform its functionality. 
They can be beans or non-beans and can be injected into a class through constructors, setters, or methods. The flexibility of dependency injection allows 
you to build more modular and maintainable applications.

In Java, a dependency can refer to various types, including:

1. **Class dependencies**: These are dependencies on classes. For example, a method that takes a `String` parameter has a dependency on the `String` class.

2. **Interface dependencies**: These are dependencies on interfaces. For instance, a method that takes a `CharSequence` parameter can accept any class that implements the `CharSequence` interface, such as `String`, `StringBuffer`, or `StringBuilder`.

3. **Method or field dependencies**: These are dependencies on specific methods or fields of an object. The class or interface of the object itself is not important, as long as it has the required method or field. For example, a method may depend on a method called `getFileName` in the class of an object passed as a parameter.

Dependencies can be direct or indirect:

- **Direct dependencies**: These are dependencies where one class directly depends on another class or interface.

- **Indirect or transitive dependencies**: These are dependencies that arise when a class depends on another class, which in turn depends on yet another class. If you cannot use class A without class B, and you cannot use class B without class C, then you cannot use class A without class C either.

In the context of Spring Dependency Injection, a dependency refers to an object that is required by another object. The dependency can be any object, including basic types like `String` or `int`, as well as complex objects. In Spring, dependencies are typically managed as beans within the ApplicationContext.

To implement Dependency Injection in Spring, you can use various techniques, including:

- **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided via constructor parameters. This is a preferred approach for mandatory dependencies.

- **Setter Injection**: Dependencies are provided via setter methods. This is useful for optional dependencies or when there are multiple dependencies.

- **Field Injection**: Dependencies are directly assigned to fields using annotations. This approach is simpler but may have limitations in terms of testability and immutability.

Here's an example of constructor injection using your provided code:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public Address address() {
        return new Address(344, "Nairobi");
    }
    
    @Bean
    public Person person(Address address) {
        return new Person(address);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` bean has a dependency on the `Address` bean. The `Address` bean is passed as a parameter to the constructor of the `Person` class during bean creation.

It's important to note that not all beans need to be defined within the `@Configuration` class. Beans can be defined in any class annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, or `@Repository`. However, the `@Configuration` class is commonly used to define and configure beans.

I hope this helps clarify the types of dependencies, how they are used in Spring Dependency Injection, and where they can be defined. Let me know if you have any further questions!
