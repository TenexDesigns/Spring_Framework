A depency is any extrenl calss or code that a class need to perform its function


e.g Here we have a ComplexBusinesService class that depends on the SoertAlgorthm class to perform a task
So the sortAlgothm is a dependecy of the ComplexyBussinessService that is nneded by the ComplexBusiinesService class for it to function well


public class ComplexBussinesService{
    SortAlgorithm sortAlgorthm;



}





Tight coupling
Where we create an instence of the class we are depending on in the dependet class e.g making an instance of the sortingAlgorthm class e.g
This is not a good practice nor  is it good code. Good code has loose coupling

public class ComplexBussinesService{
    SortAlgorithm sortAlgorthm  = new SoertAlgorthm();



}


loose copuing
Here the specif code is not depndey on a specific type of code
Here we pass the nnneded algorthm as a parameter throth he constructor



public class ComplexBussinesService(sorthingAlgorthm){
   this.algorthm  = new SoertAlgorthm();



}




HOW SPRING FRAMWORK FALLS INTO ALL OF THIS

 -> WHat is spring - Speing is a depency injection framwork
This two help with depency injection in spring fraework.
@Componenent
@Autowired


@Componenent
public class ComplexBussinesService(sorthingAlgorthm){

  @Autowired
  SortingAlgorthm SoertAlgorthm();



}

The above menas that for evevtu instance wit a n @Component decorator, It requres an @Autowired Depencdecy
e.g   The above meas that for evevy instance of ComplexBussinesService, It requres an SortingAlgorthm Depencdecy

The core use of spring framework is depency injection, as seen above .in that you dont have to outline the dpendecies nnedded, bt spring framwork will tell you the dependecies needded.

TERMINOLOGY IN SPRING FRAEWORK
Beans
Autowiring
Depency Injection
Inversion of Control
IOC  Container
Application Context



1.Beans - 
      ------>  beans are the instances that  spring framwork manages and ensures that their depencies are met
              .eg ComplexBusiinsesService is a beans .(It has the @Copmponet decorator that tells spring frawork it has a dependcy nneded)


2. Autowiring - 
     -------> Process by which spring frawork identifies the dependecies, identifes th matces for the dependecy and populates them

3.Inversion of Controll -
     -------> The spring framwork creates an instance of the neede deppencies in the classes that need them

4..IOC Container -
    --------> Anything that is implememnting inversion of control

5.Application Container 
   ---------> Is what Houses the IOC container. it where ll beans are created and managed

6.Depency Injection
   ---------> Is iseting what are depended on the   class







-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You're on the right track in understanding dependency injection and its relevance in the Spring Framework. Let me clarify and correct a few points to ensure your understanding is accurate:

1. **Dependency:**
   - You defined it correctly as any external class or code that a class needs to perform its function. However, dependencies are not limited to external classes only; they can also include other services, components, or resources.

2. **Tight Coupling:**
   - Correct. Tight coupling occurs when one class is directly dependent on the concrete implementation of another class. It's generally considered undesirable because it makes code harder to maintain and change.

3. **Loose Coupling:**
   - Youre close, but the example provided is not entirely correct. In loose coupling, a class doesn't depend directly on a specific implementation, but rather on an abstraction or interface. Passing the needed algorithm as a parameter through the constructor is indeed a form of achieving loose coupling.

Now, lets clarify and correct the points related to Spring Framework and dependency injection:

1. **What is Spring Framework:**
   - Correct, Spring Framework is indeed a dependency injection framework. But it's not just that; it also offers a wide range of other features, like aspect-oriented programming, data access, transaction management, and more.

2. **Annotations and Dependency Injection in Spring:**
   - You mentioned `@Component` and `@Autowired`, but in the code snippet, there's a little confusion. The `@Autowired` annotation is used to inject dependencies into classes, not to create new instances. And you don't need to create instances using `new` when using `@Autowired`. Spring manages the creation of instances for you.
   - The correct code should be:
     ```java
     @Component
     public class ComplexBussinesService {
         @Autowired
         SortingAlgorithm sortingAlgorithm;
     }
     ```

3. **Dependency Injection in Spring:**
   - Spring indeed handles dependency injection, but it doesnt just tell you the dependencies needed. Instead, you declare the dependencies, and Spring takes care of fulfilling them. In your example, you've correctly used `@Autowired` to let Spring know that the `SortingAlgorithm` dependency should be injected into `ComplexBusinessService`.
You have a good understanding of dependency injection and how it works in the Spring framework. Let's clarify some points:

1. **Dependency**: Youre correct. A dependency is any external class or code that a class needs to perform its function. In your example, `SortAlgorithm` is indeed a dependency of `ComplexBusinessService`.

2. **Tight Coupling**: You're correct again. When a class directly instantiates a dependency, it's called tight coupling. This is not a good practice because it makes the code less flexible and harder to test.

3. **Loose Coupling**: This is where dependency injection comes in. Instead of directly instantiating the dependency, the dependency is provided (or "injected") into the class, often through a constructor or a setter method. This makes the code more flexible and easier to test.

4. **Spring Framework and Dependency Injection**: Spring Framework simplifies the process of dependency injection. The `@Component` annotation tells Spring that a class is a bean and should be managed by the Spring container. The `@Autowired` annotation tells Spring to automatically inject the necessary dependencies.

5. **Beans**: In Spring, a bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container. These beans are created with the configuration metadata that you supply to the container.

6. **Autowiring**: This is the process by which Spring automatically resolves the dependency by matching the beans in the Spring container. This eliminates the need for specifying the beans to be injected explicitly.

7. **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: This is a principle in software engineering where the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. In the context of Spring, the IoC container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans by reading the configuration metadata.

8. **IoC Container**: The IoC container is the core of the Spring Framework. It creates the objects, wires them together, configures them, and manages their complete lifecycle.

9. **Application Context**: This is the interface for an advanced factory capable of maintaining a registry of different beans and their dependencies. By using the ApplicationContext, Spring makes sure that all these dependencies are initialized and ready for use.

10. **Dependency Injection**: This is a design pattern where objects are passed as dependencies instead of creating them within the class. This reduces the coupling between classes and moves the responsibility of managing components onto the container.

Your understanding of these concepts is quite good. Keep in mind that understanding these principles and how they work in Spring is crucial for developing applications using this framework.

  
Remember that the core concept of Spring Framework is to provide a framework for building applications with loose coupling and modular design through dependency injection. It allows you to focus on writing business logic while leaving the management of dependencies to the framework. Keep practicing and experimenting to solidify your understanding.
